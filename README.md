A computational framework that assesses different machine learning algorithms ability to predict antibiotic resistance phenotype of bacterial strains that lack known antimicrobial resistance genes yet demonstrate resistance to drugs of those families.
The machine learning algorithms' performance is evaluated in predicting resistance trait using the whole-genome sequencing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genetic data and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) phenotypic data.

The AMR-AST data can be accessed in the Data folder of this repository.

Please refer to the AMR prediction Jupyter Notebook for a reproducible workflow, analysis and visualization of the data for the framework.
The framework also exports performance results data and 300 dpi figures for better visualization.
