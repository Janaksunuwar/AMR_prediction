A computational framework that assesses different machine learning algorithms ability to predict antibiotic resistance phenotype of bacterial strains that lack known antimicrobial resistance genes yet demonstrate resistance to drugs of those families.
The machine learning algorithms' performance is evaluated in predicting resistance trait using the whole-genome sequencing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genetic data and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) phenotypic data.

Please refer to the AMR prediction Jupyter Notebook for a reproducible loading, analyzing and visualizing the data for the framework.
